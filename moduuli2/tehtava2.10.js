//Write a voting program as described below for small-scale meeting use. (8p)
//The program asks for the number of candidates.
//Then the program asks for the names of the candidates: 'Name for candidate 1
//Store the candidates' names and initial vote count in objects like this:
// [
//     {
//         name: 'ellie',
//         votes: 0,
//     },
//     {
//         name: 'frank',
//         votes: 0,
//     },
//     {
//         name: 'pamela',
//         votes: 0,
//     },
// ]
//The program asks for the number of voters.
//The program asks each voter in turn who they will vote for. Voter shoud enter candidate name.
//If the voter enters an empty value instead of the voting number, it will be interpreted as an empty vote.
//The program announces the name of the winner and the results by printing it to the console:
//The winner is pamela with 3 votes.
// results:
// pamela: 3 votes
// frank: 1 votes
// ellie: 1 votes
// Some help:
//You need to compare votes so console log a and b to see how to get the correct property.
// someArray.sort((a, b) => {
//    console.log(a, b);
//    return b - a;
// });
